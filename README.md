### TrackMeCode
> What you can measure, you can manage

Simple utility heavily inspired by [Paul Taykalo's xcode-time-tracker](https://github.com/PaulTaykalo/xcode-time-tracker).

To check out possible use cases, feel free to have a look at my talks ["Debug like a Pro"](https://drobinin.com/talks/2018/debug-like-a-pro/) and ["Debug like a Pro v2"](https://drobinin.com/talks/2019/debug-like-a-pro-v2/), where I expand on motivation behind tracking my build and run times and show a few tricks to reduce it significantly.
